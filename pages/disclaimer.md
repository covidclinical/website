## Race & Ethnicity

The 4CE Consortium acknowledges that characterizing the significance of race and ethnicity in the COVID-19 pandemic is essential.
In an effort to produce rapid results, sites initially mapped their local race/ethnicity ontology terms to the US-based NIH race categories.
While this standardization gives us a broad sense of race and ethnicity across the 4CE Consortium, it cannot address the complex social and genetic relationship between race/ethnicity and illness on a global scale.
We recommend early-phase race data only be included in analysis for U.S. sites at this juncture.
Future iterations of our data will include country-specific race and ethnicity categorizations to more accurately, rather than broadly, capture this information.

4CE cannot and does not warrant that access to the site will be error- or virus-free and does not guarantee against unauthorized users or hackers attempting to obtain access to this website.
